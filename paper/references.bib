  abstract = {Most existing deep neural networks are susceptible to the influence of adversarial examples, which may cause them to output incorrect prediction results. An adversarial example is the addition of small noise disturbances to the input data samples, which will deceive the classification. Generally, these modifications are very small noise disturbances, which are not easily noticed by the human eye. However, most existing adversarial attacks achieve only low success rates in typical black-box settings, where the attackers have no prior knowledge about the model structures and/or model parameters. To tackle this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on an acceleration gradient to enhance the adversary attack. Our method accumulates the gradient of the loss function in each iteration and uses the next gradient information to influence the future gradient. We also introduce the scaling invariance principle of a deep neural network to optimize the input images for black-box attacks. In addition, to handle the drawbacks of a traditional iterative fast gradient sign method, we further present two gradient optimization methods. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset show that our attack methods can achieve good transferability. In addition, those models obtained by integrated adversarial training with strong defense capability are also quite vulnerable to our black-box attack.}

  abstract  = {The adversarial examples show the vulnerability of deep neural networks, which makes adversarial attacks widely concerned. However, most of the attack methods are based on image classification model. In this paper, we use Momentum Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (MI-FGSM), which stabilize optimization and escape from poor local maxima, to generate adversarial examples on the Faster R-CNN object detector. We have made some improvements on the previous object detection attack methods. The best current attack method, Project Gradient Descent (PGD) on object detection, starts from a random value, resulting in the uncertainty of the attack result. In contrast, our attacks are more stable and powerful in both white-box attacks and black-box attacks, and can better adapt to various neural network architectures. Experiment on Pascal VOC2007 shows that, under same setting of white-box attack, PGD has 0.23% mean average precision (mAP) on Faster R-CNN with VGG16, while our method achieves 0.17%. In addition, we analyze the difference between classification and detection attacks, and find that in addition to misclassification, the adversarial examples produced by detection models can also lead to mislocation.},
