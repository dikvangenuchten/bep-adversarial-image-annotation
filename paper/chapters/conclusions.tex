\begin{itemize}
    \item S.A.T. is susceptible to adversarial samples, with the most important part in generating them is the amount of iterations. (This could use some more plots)
    \item Successful attacks are visible in the attention layer, even if not attack explicitly.
    \item The attention layer is susceptible to attacks.
    \item Attacking the attention is harder than attacking the sentence.
    \item Summarizing in attacking using the (iterative) fast gradient sign method, the most important part is iterations.
\end{itemize}
