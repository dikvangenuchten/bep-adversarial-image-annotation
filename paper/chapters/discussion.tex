\begin{itemize}
    \item Cosine similarity is based on a learned value, it is not a watertight value. (But neither is BLEU)
    \item How useful is the iterative method for training, as it takes a significant time to compute.
    \item Future work:
          \subitem If the adversarial samples generated are included during training is the model more robust.
          \subitem Are the adversarial samples transferable to other models, even ones not employing attention?
\end{itemize}
