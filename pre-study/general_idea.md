# Goal
Goal of the BEP is to generate a new benchmark tool for NLP. Preferably using adversarial attack as to make it dynamic and thus robuster to exploitation. I am intrested in applying Adversarial Image Attack (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03728.pdf) on a Image Annotation Model (e.g. https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2671188.2749391).

# Information flow
The adversarial model should be able to produce a low noise field, which can be added to the image, such that the model will predict something completly different but for a human it should still be recognizable.
